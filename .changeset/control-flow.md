Add `Switch`/`Match`, `Dynamic`, `Portal`, `lazy` and `Suspense`. `Suspense` shows its fallback until the first load of every `lazy` component and `createResource` inside it has finished. The renderer interface gets an optional `portalRoot()` (the DOM renderer returns `document.body`). The Vite plugin makes the children of `Suspense`, `Portal` and `Match`, and the `fallback` of `Suspense` and `Switch`, lazy, and wraps `Match`'s `when` and `Dynamic`'s `is`.
